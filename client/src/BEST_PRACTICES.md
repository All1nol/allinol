# Best Practices for Clean, Reusable Code

This document outlines the best practices for writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code in our React TypeScript application.

## Component Structure

### 1. Reusable UI Components

Create reusable UI components that can be used across the application. These components should:

- Accept props with well-defined TypeScript interfaces
- Have sensible defaults
- Be composable
- Handle their own styling
- Be accessible

Examples:
- `Button.tsx`: A reusable button component with different variants, sizes, and states
- `FormInput.tsx`: A reusable form input component with validation support
- `Modal.tsx`: A reusable modal component

### 2. Container Components vs. Presentational Components

Follow the container/presentational pattern:

- **Container Components**: Handle data fetching, state management, and business logic
- **Presentational Components**: Focus on rendering UI based on props

This separation makes components more reusable and easier to test.

## Custom Hooks

Create custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic:

- `useForm.ts`: A hook for form handling, validation, and submission
- `useAuth.ts`: A hook for authentication-related logic
- `useFetch.ts`: A hook for data fetching with loading, error, and success states

## Services

Create service modules to handle API calls and external interactions:

- Keep API calls in dedicated service files
- Use TypeScript interfaces for request and response types
- Handle errors consistently
- Implement retry logic where appropriate

## Validation

Create reusable validation utilities:

- Define validation functions for common use cases (required, email, min/max length, etc.)
- Compose validators for complex validation rules
- Create form-specific validators using the utility functions

## State Management

Choose the appropriate state management approach based on the scope:

- **Component State**: Use `useState` for component-specific state
- **Context API**: Use for state that needs to be shared across multiple components
- **Redux/Zustand**: Use for complex global state management

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Define interfaces for all props, state, and data structures
- Use union types for props with multiple possible values
- Use generics for reusable components and hooks
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use type guards to narrow types when necessary

## File Organization

Organize files by feature or domain:

```
src/
  components/
    ui/            # Reusable UI components
    auth/          # Authentication-related components
    admin/         # Admin-related components
  hooks/           # Custom hooks
  services/        # API services
  utils/           # Utility functions
  types/           # TypeScript interfaces and types
  context/         # React context providers
  pages/           # Page components
```

## Code Style

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use destructuring for props and state
- Use the spread operator for immutable updates

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for UI components
- Use mock services for testing components that make API calls
- Test edge cases and error handling

## Performance Optimization

- Use memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`) for expensive calculations or to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement code splitting for large applications
- Use virtualization for long lists
- Optimize images and assets

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

By following these best practices, we can create a codebase that is clean, maintainable, and scalable.
